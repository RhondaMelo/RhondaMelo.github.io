<p>I have re worked my final web page and it is now at this location</p>


<p>I am tryign to scrape the 112 unoffical guide webpage for one part of my page this is where i was still having a slow patch. I am taking time now to learn  javascript and understand the  code that is used for scraping the web page

So far i have been able to pull down the site and now i am working on scrubbing the page to the bits that i need.

Worse case I will just have iframe as a place holder so the page at least has a clean flow to it as the other pages. But i will firgure out web scrubbing 

Ealy in week 3 i decided taht i wanted to take a break form the 112 things project. i wanted to  focus on learming HTMl CSS and javascript and I wanted to start creating a protfolio that  people will be able ot see
 I decided to being the onTrackToFullStack prject. in this project

 I put  my projects That i have been working on during my three week. thime. i will still be going back to do comments in all of th eprojects and there should be a time line project added soon. On monday my imac died and  I am hopign they will be able to recover my timeline project as that one took about 6 horus to do. i am jsut glad that i pshed my other things to github before the computer died

 I think I have learned alot in the class and will continue with more HTML css and javascript projects including my next step of creating a basic game. perhaps tic tac toe</p>
