I have re worked my final web page and it is now at this location

https://github.com/RhondaMelo/a112things


I am tryign to scrape the 112 unoffical guide webpage for one part of my page this is where i was still having a slow patch. I am taking time now to learn  javascript and understand the  code that is used for scraping the web page

So far i have been able to pull down the site and now i am working on scrubbing the page to the bits that i need.

Worse case I will just have iframe as a place holder so the page at least has a clean flow to it as the other pages. But i will firgure out web scrubbing
